  Lake Merritt is currently a 155 acre recreational lake east of downtown
  Oakland, encircled by a 3.4 mile multi-use path.


  Lake Merritt was originally a 1000 acre tidal estuary fed by the San Antonio
  watershed. The Chochenyo people used it for fish and game.


  In 1810, the Chochenyo people were relocated to Mission San Jose, and in 1820,
  the lake was given to Luis MarÃ­a Peralta by the Spanish.


  Circa 1853, a toll bridge was built across the south side of the lake. The
  lake served as an open air sewer and waste was sent to the bottom by wooden
  channels.


  In 1868, Carpentier, Merritt, and Leland Stanford formed the Oakland
  Waterfront Company and acquired the lake. Later that year, they sold 500 acres
  to the Western Pacific Railroad.


  In 1869, the Oakland Waterfront Company placed a dam at 12th street, deepening
  the lake and narrowing its coverage.  This eliminated the need for the toll
  bridge.


  In 1870, Governor Henry Haight established Lake Merritt as North America's
  first wildlife refuge.


  In 1890, the Oakland Waterfront Company gave the lake to the city of Oakland.
  The city dredged the lake to create a park and circled the lake with roads.


  In 1970, the city added pumping stations to control salinity and runoff,
  fountains to oxygenate the water, and added culverts under 12th street.


  The lake was designated an Oakland landmark in 1980.
