description: >-
  > Philip Joseph Port, a longtime resident of West Oakland, gave the land for
  this park as a memorial to his wife. A native of Vermont who came to Oakland
  in the 1890s when he was not yet 20, Mr. Port worked for many years as a
  milkman, making deliveries with horsedrawn wagons and later by truck. He
  married Bertha Bastian, the daughter of a German-born blacksmith and neighbor,
  and the couple continued to make their home on Eighth Street. 

  >

  > In the late 1930s, not long after Bertha died, the Oakland Housing Authority
  began buying property in the neighborhood. Philip loved West Oakland and
  protested the bulldozing of its old homes for housing projects like Campbell
  Village. Yet he also cared for the people who lived there, especially the
  children. So, he added a provision to his will, donating a quarter acre lot at
  Eight and Wood Streets for a public playground.

  >

  > On the eve of Thanksgiving in 1947, three years after Philip's death, the
  City's Mayor formally declared Bertha Bastian Port Playground. Intended for
  mothers with preschool children, the ground had swings, slides, and picnic
  tables. Decades later, the nonprofit Trust for Public Land secured fudning,
  surveyed residents, and sought the services of a local landscape designer. A
  community block party in July 2006 celebrated the reopening of Bertha Port
  Park, a renewed gift to the West Oakland Community for the 21st century.
