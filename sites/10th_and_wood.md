description: >-
  A cafe in West Oakland that serves eclectic American fusion food, such as the
  "Po-Mi" sandwich (Bahn Mi + Po Boy). The restaurant has been [noted as an
  example of
  gentrification](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/feb/11/oakland-from-gritty-to-gentrified-photos)
  in West Oakland, though the owner Levitansky has stated that it's important
  for him not to have "gentrified prices": a meal here costs $9-10. The cafe has
  received largely positive reviews.
