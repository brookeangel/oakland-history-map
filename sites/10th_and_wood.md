> Since 1994, Trapeze Arts, Inc. has been teaching flying trapeze and other   circus arts to adults and children of all ages and is one of only a handful of full time Circus Schools in the United States.

> In October 2000, we opened our doors to our full time, year round indoor   Oakland facility. We have approximately 10,000 sq.ft. of space, filled with a flying trapeze, trampolines, trapezes, hoops, tissues, ropes, a tightwire, tumbletrack trampoline, unicycles and all kinds of juggling equipment.
