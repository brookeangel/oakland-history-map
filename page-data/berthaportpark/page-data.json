A native of Vermont who came to Oakland\nin the 1890s when he was not yet 20, Mr. Port worked for many years as a\nmilkman, making deliveries with horsedrawn wagons and later by truck. He\nmarried Bertha Bastian, the daughter of a German-born blacksmith and neighbor,\nand the couple continued to make their home on Eighth Street. </p>\n<p>In the late 1930s, not long after Bertha died, the Oakland Housing Authority   began buying property in the neighborhood. Philip loved West Oakland and\nprotested the bulldozing of its old homes for housing projects like Campbell\nVillage. Yet he also cared for the people who lived there, especially the\nchildren. So, he added a provision to his will, donating a quarter acre lot at\nEight and Wood Streets for a public playground.</p>\n<p>On the eve of Thanksgiving in 1947, three years after Philip's death, the   City's Mayor formally declared Bertha Bastian Port Playground. Intended for\nmothers with preschool children, the ground had swings, slides, and picnic\ntables. Decades later, the nonprofit Trust for Public Land secured fudning,\nsurveyed residents, and sought the services of a local landscape designer. A\ncommunity block party in July 2006 celebrated the reopening of Bertha Port\nPark, a renewed gift to the West Oakland Community for the 21st century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>  <em>Bay Trail informational sign</em> </p>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>From the sign near Bertha Port Park, marking historical locations along the Bay Trail.</li>\n</ul>","id":"ca2cb026-8152-5d72-a658-3956e551fe39","frontmatter":{"name":"Bertha Port Park","path":"/berthaportpark","entryDate":"2020-03-11T19:48:04.388Z","startDate":"1947-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","endDate":"","location":{"coords":[-122.30233483480825,37.8079501]}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
