The Chochenyo people used it for fish and game.</p>\n<p>  In 1810, the Chochenyo people were relocated to Mission San Jose, and in 1820,\nthe lake was given to Luis Mar√≠a Peralta by the Spanish.</p>\n<p>  Circa 1853, a toll bridge was built across the south side of the lake. The\nlake served as an open air sewer and waste was sent to the bottom by wooden\nchannels.</p>\n<p>  In 1868, Carpentier, Merritt, and Leland Stanford formed the Oakland\nWaterfront Company and acquired the lake. Later that year, they sold 500 acres\nto the Western Pacific Railroad.</p>\n<p>  In 1869, the Oakland Waterfront Company placed a dam at 12th street, deepening\nthe lake and narrowing its coverage.  This eliminated the need for the toll\nbridge.</p>\n<p>  In 1870, Governor Henry Haight established Lake Merritt as North America's\nfirst wildlife refuge.</p>\n<p>  In 1890, the Oakland Waterfront Company gave the lake to the city of Oakland.\nThe city dredged the lake to create a park and circled the lake with roads.</p>\n<p>  In 1970, the city added pumping stations to control salinity and runoff,\nfountains to oxygenate the water, and added culverts under 12th street.</p>\n<p>  The lake was designated an Oakland landmark in 1980.</p>\n<h2>Sources:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>LocalWiki Contributors, \"Lake Merritt\" <em>Oakland Wiki,</em> Local Wiki, 19\nFebruary 2020, <a href=\"https://localwiki.org/oakland/Lake_Merritt\">https://localwiki.org/oakland/Lake_Merritt</a>.</li>\n</ul>","id":"70e086c3-023f-5e83-9922-fc040f910ed8","frontmatter":{"name":"Lake Merritt","path":"/sites/lake-merritt","entryDate":"2020-02-20T01:58:26.382Z","startDate":"2020-02-20T01:58:26.398Z","endDate":"2020-02-20T01:58:26.409Z","location":{"coords":[-122.25624380468363,37.8046042]}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
